# COVID-19-analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create an interactive COVID-19 analysis dashboard that visualizes key epidemiological data to provide actionable insights into the pandemic's spread, vaccination efforts, and testing status. 
This dashboard leverages a comprehensive dataset containing information on confirmed cases, cured individuals, deaths, vaccine administration details, and testing statistics across various states and demographic groups in India. By presenting this data in a clear and accessible format, the project aims to facilitate a better understanding of the COVID-19 landscape and support informed decision-making for public health initiatives.

## Tools used
Microsoft Excel – For initial data cleaning, exploration, and basic analysis
SQL – For querying data efficiently
Tableau – For interactive data visualization, dashboards, and deriving business insights

## Key Questions:

1. What is the total number of deaths by state? 
2. What are the details of COVID-19 cases by age group? 
3. How have COVID-19 cases (confirmed, cured, and deaths) evolved over time by state/union territory? 
4. How many doses have been administered for each vaccine type (CoviShield, Covaxin, Sputnik V)? 
5. What is the comparison between the first and second doses administered? 
6. What is the count of ICMR testing labs by state? 
7. What are the state-wise details for negative tests, positive tests, and total samples? 

## Key analysis & insights 

- Maharashtra consistently appears as a highly impacted state across various metrics, leading in total deaths, ICMR testing labs, and overall testing volume. This indicates a significant COVID-19 burden and robust testing infrastructure in the region.
- Vaccination efforts show a substantial gap between first and second doses administered, with first doses significantly outnumbering second doses. This suggests a need to accelerate the administration of second doses to achieve full vaccination coverage.
- The age group 30-39 and 20-29 collectively represent a large portion of COVID-19 cases, highlighting the impact on the young adult and working-age population. Targeted public health messaging and vaccination campaigns for these demographics could be beneficial.
- The overall trend of confirmed cases, cured cases, and deaths shows a continuous upward trajectory over the monitored period. This indicates an ongoing public health challenge requiring sustained intervention and monitoring.

## Recommendation:

- To further mitigate the impact of COVID-19, it is crucial to intensify the administration of second vaccine doses to ensure complete immunization coverage across the population.
- Furthermore, targeted public health campaigns should be designed to reach and educate the highly affected 20-39 age group, emphasizing preventive measures and vaccine uptake.
- States with a high burden of cases and deaths, such as Maharashtra, should receive continued support for testing and healthcare infrastructure.
- Continuous monitoring of emerging variants and their impact on different age groups is also essential for adaptive public health strategies.
- Lastly, fostering collaborations between state governments and research institutions can enhance testing capabilities and epidemiological tracking.

## Conclusion:

The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the COVID-19 situation, revealing critical insights into case distribution, vaccination progress, and testing efforts across different states and demographics. While significant strides have been made in vaccination and testing, the persistent rise in cases and the disparity in dose administration underscore the need for sustained and targeted public health interventions. Addressing these areas effectively will be crucial in moving towards better control of the pandemic
